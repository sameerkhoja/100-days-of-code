# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Dove into React using the Facebook docs, learned about state and properties and followed along examples.

**Thoughts:** React essentially utilizes JSX to make HTML modular. Through functions and classes, one can store state and properties into HTML components to introduce a new level of dynamic web development.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished reading FB's React docs, also learned about Firebase for fun.

**Thoughts:** Getting more used to the way React works, documentation has been the best way to learn!

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Dove into BackboneJS, learning what it's used for and walked through basic examples.

**Thoughts:** BackboneJS and React seem to overlap a bit when it comes to how things are viewed on the browser. BackboneJS, however, has support for Models and Collections and can store data locally using localStorage.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Did all four parts to this [BackboneJS tutorial](http://adrianmejia.com/blog/2012/09/11/backbone-dot-js-for-absolute-beginners-getting-started/). Learned a TON. 

**Thoughts:** Getting more used to the way React works, documentation has been the best way to learn!
