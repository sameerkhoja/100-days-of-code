# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Dove into React using the Facebook docs, learned about state and properties and followed along examples.

**Thoughts:** React essentially utilizes JSX to make HTML modular. Through functions and classes, one can store state and properties into HTML components to introduce a new level of dynamic web development.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished reading FB's React docs, also learned about Firebase for fun. Also learned about Gulp and Browserify and made a sample app that defines and runs Gulp build tasks.

**Thoughts:** Getting more used to the way React works, documentation has been the best way to learn! Gulp and browserify are very easy to pick up.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Dove into BackboneJS, learning what it's used for and walked through basic examples.

**Thoughts:** BackboneJS and React seem to overlap a bit when it comes to how things are viewed on the browser. BackboneJS, however, has support for Models and Collections and can store data locally using localStorage.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Did all four parts to this [BackboneJS tutorial](http://adrianmejia.com/blog/2012/09/11/backbone-dot-js-for-absolute-beginners-getting-started/). Learned a TON. 

**Thoughts:** Getting more used to the way React works, documentation has been the best way to learn!

### Day 4: January 6, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Went super in-depth into GraphQL, learned and used express-graphql and graphiql

**Thoughts:** GraphQL is AMAZING and much easier/more efficient than an API call. With only one endpoint, the client has all the say in how it wants its JSON to look like, rather than being forced to parse whatever the API gives. 

### Day 5: January 7, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Learned more GraphQL as it applies to database queries, learned how to use with SQL and MongoDB. Also learned what Promises are and why they're used.

**Thoughts:** Promises make a lot of sense when I looked into it, and as I do this I'm learning more about how JS as a language works.

### Day 6: January 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went over Big O example questions from Cracking the Coding Interview.

**Thoughts:** Not too bad, looking to get into algorithms soon.
